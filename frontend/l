<em>Objective:</em> <br />
My name is Kyryl Melekhin and I am first year student at Florida Institute Of Technology. <br />
I have been doing programming for the last 2 years, most of which includes personal projects. <br />
It has been my dream for those last years to become software engineer and I am working hard towards that. <br />
I stepped on the path of science long before I knew my destination, so meanwhile when I was still searching <br />
for my major I was able to gain variety of other skills including electrical circuit designs, automotive industry <br />
and physics on my own time. My areas of interest lie in graphics programming and low level systems, as my <br />
passion has always been inspired by knowing how a system actually works. I may have or not qualificaions needed but please <br />
give me a chance to learn the technology I may not be falimiar with. <br /> <br />
